# Photonics Computer
Developing Photonics Computer OS for home and buisness users. Photonics Computers are based on photonic qubits.

Photonics Quantum Computer will allow existing Classical Computer OS like Windows, Mac, Linux and Other Operating Systems to install in the Quantum Computer.

Quantum Mechanics is the study of nature at the atomic level especially Electrons, Photons and more.

Everyday when you wake up and see, the sun rises in the east because our beautiful planet Earth rotates around Sun every 365 days. Because of earth in continuous motion, the atoms which are considered to be building blocks of earth seems to be in certain oscillations or vibrations in nature also.

Structure of Atom: Atom consists of Nucleus made up of Positive charged particles Protons and particles with neutral charge called as Neutrons.

Electrons are negative charged particles rotates around nucleus in an orbit.

Superposition: Sub-atomic particles like Electrons and Photons said to be in continuous oscillation like wave. Electrons said to rotate around Nucleus in Spin Up and Spin Down conditions in an Atom.
Photons are considered to be in wave like particles.

Quantum Computer: We are going to use Electrons and Photons in nature considered to be in Oscillation or in Wave. In Classical Computer, We used binary digits like 0 and 1 to do calculations which is similar to toss a coin in the air and predicting the outcome with certainty. 

Nature has given us coins like Electrons and Photons with continuous oscillation of two sides, Electrons may oscillate between Spin Up and Down states continuously. Photons may exhibit oscillations of vertical or horizontal alignment of wave particles in a path or medium continuously. When you toss a Photon or Electron coin in the air, it will fall in the ground with continuous oscillation of Head or Tile which is similar to coin being rotated with two sides in the ground like 0 and 1.

Entanglement in Quantum Computer: In Photonics Quantum Computer, Polarization of two photons at the same time is called as Entanglement.

Qubit Entanglement - 2 to the power of N - when two atoms are entangled with 2 atom states.

N - Atoms Entanglement - N to the power of N - when N no of atoms entangled with N no of atoms states.

Photonics Topics: Photonic Integrated Circuit, Photons, Laser Emitters, Waveguides, Resonators, Modulators and Photodetectors. 

Power of Photonics Computers: A calculation will take more than 10,000 years to complete in classical supercomputer available currently whereas the photonic qubits based computer will complete in 100 microseconds.

Photonics Circuit Stimulation Softwares: Ansys Lumerical, Cadence Virtuoso and others.

Photonic Integrated Circuit: Silicon Photonics or Photonic chips are made up of Silicon Fabrication technology and Photonic Components  to create Quantum Computer.

Silicon Wafers of thickness 200 mm and above.

Laser Light source of 1550 nm or suitable wavelength to produce photons. Photons will be passed through beam spliter to create single photons. Single photons will be polarized using interferometer like Mach-Zender Interferometer. Polarized photons will be used to create quantum neural networks or quantum logical gates to do computations. Outcome of computations will be detected in photodetectors like germanium.

Wave guides are used to guide or channelize photons in a medium. Example: Lithium Niobate and more.

Quantum processor will allow user to save the computation in electronic signal whenever the user require to do or will carry out the computations in continuous loop at light speed allowing or stepping all of us into next revolution of computing.

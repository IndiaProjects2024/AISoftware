# Photonic Computer
Developing Photonic Computer OS for home and buisness users. Photonic Computers are based on photonic qubits.

Photonics Topics: Photonic Integrated Circuit, Photons, Laser Emitters, Waveguides, Resonators, Modulators and Photodetectors. 

Power of Photonic Computers: A calculation will take more than 10,000 years to complete in classical supercomputer available currently whereas the photonic qubits based computer will complete in 100 microseconds.

Photonic Circuit Stimulation Softwares: Ansys Lumerical, Cadence Virtuoso and others.

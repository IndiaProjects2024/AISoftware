# Photonics Computer
Developing Photonics Computer OS for home and buisness users. Photonics Computers are based on photonic qubits.

Quantum Mechanics is the study of  nature at the atomic level especially Electrons, Photons and more.

Everyday when you wake up and see, the sun rises in the east because our beautiful planet Earth rotates around Sun every 365 days. Because of earth in continuous motion, the atoms which are considered to be building blocks of earth seems to be in certain oscillations or vibrations in nature also.

Structure of Atom: Atom consists of Nucleus made up of Positive charged particles Protons and particles with neutral charge called as Neutrons.

Electrons are negative charged particles rotates around nucleus in an orbit.

Entanglement in Quantum Computer: In Photonics Quantum Computer, Polarization of two photons at the same time is called as Entanglement.

Qubit Entanglement - 2 to the power of N - when two atoms are entangled with 2 atom states.

N - Atoms Entanglement - N to the power of N - when N no of atoms entangled with N no of atoms states.

Photonics Topics: Photonic Integrated Circuit, Photons, Laser Emitters, Waveguides, Resonators, Modulators and Photodetectors. 

Power of Photonics Computers: A calculation will take more than 10,000 years to complete in classical supercomputer available currently whereas the photonic qubits based computer will complete in 100 microseconds.

Photonics Circuit Stimulation Softwares: Ansys Lumerical, Cadence Virtuoso and others.

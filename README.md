# Photonics Computer
Developing Photonics Computer OS for home and buisness users. Photonics Computers are based on photonic qubits.

Entanglement in Quantum Computer: In Photonics Quantum Computer, Polarization of two photons at the same time is called as Entanglement.

Qubit Entanglement - 2 to the power of N - when two atoms are entangled with 2 atom states.

N - Atoms Entanglement - N to the power of N - when N no of atoms entangled with N no of atoms states.

Photonics Topics: Photonic Integrated Circuit, Photons, Laser Emitters, Waveguides, Resonators, Modulators and Photodetectors. 

Power of Photonics Computers: A calculation will take more than 10,000 years to complete in classical supercomputer available currently whereas the photonic qubits based computer will complete in 100 microseconds.

Photonics Circuit Stimulation Softwares: Ansys Lumerical, Cadence Virtuoso and others.
